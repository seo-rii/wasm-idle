# @wasm-idle/debug

Optional debugger UI, session controller, expression helpers, language adapters, and Monaco editor
integration for wasm-idle. Install it separately in applications that provide debugging:

pnpm add @wasm-idle/debug

The Monaco integration is available from `@wasm-idle/debug/editor`; `monaco-editor` is an optional
peer dependency. This package contains code only and includes no runtime, compiler, WebAssembly, or
toolchain assets.
